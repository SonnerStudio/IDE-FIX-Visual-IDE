## 🌟 Vision

IDE-FIX revolutionizes the way we program. As a complete visual IDE, it combines the proven functionality of Visual Studio Code with an innovative visual programming approach.

**What makes it special:** Instead of loading components from a library, you pull them from a **magic hat** 🎩 – a symbol of creativity and unlimited possibilities.

**Your companion:** **Fix** 🐾, a friendly digital dog, supports you with AI-powered assistance and transforms programming into an intuitive, artistic experience.
